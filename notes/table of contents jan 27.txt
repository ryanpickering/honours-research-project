okay, so after finagling all week, finally have material for table of contents. from my sheet of paper...

Intro - 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 48
DF Intro: Elements of gameplay, etc. - 42, 59, 60, 61
DF Narrativization intro - 42, 59, 60, 61, 62
Historical Thinking Concepts in "Edu-games" (a no-go) - 24-35
Historical Thinking Concepts in DF Narrativization - 24, 27
- hist. significance - 76, 40, 50, 67, 73a, 73b
- primary sources - 77, 39, 41, 63, 67, 73b, 74
- continuity and change - 79, 68, 71
- cause and consequence - 79, 68, 71
- hist perspective - 80, 40, 63, 72, 73a
- ethical dimension - 81, 40, 63, 72, 73a
implications for other games / history - nothing to go on atm

this is the first draft. 

what this means - number at end are paragraph numbers from what i have written. there is more than a fair bit of stuff right now that can work within the larger thesis. nothing to go for that last paragraph, though... 
- does that last section work as a conclusion?

- is there too much intro? maybe...
- it already feels very clunky, and nothing has been even done with it. ugh

ideas for round 2: 
- combine 2 and 3: narrativization included within initial discussion of DF fleshes that section out, at the end of the chapter we have both an understanding of DF and a jumping off point into hist thinking
- find two games/stories/narrative etc from forums (hall of fame) to fit under each hist. thinking concepts... kills two birds w/ one stone
- fit edu-games material into general discussion on each hist. thinking tool... where it fails (other edu-games) vs. where it succeeds (DF)
	- allows for easy reference and comparison that is specific. 
- in each thinking concept, talk about both GAME and NARRATIVE - speak to each other. for example, new features in DF informing future narrativization. 

ROUND 2-----

after engaging with different stories, looking what is available to work with in all, idea of talking about individual stories in each section doesn't work. INSTEAD: talk about the explanation, then how it hasn't worked in videogames, then how it HAS worked in DF. fixed above. 

where to fit conversation about community in??

notes...
- in blog post about 90s games, i didn't really do any discussion of actual aspects OF those games that is usable for those sections - more work is need there
- already, looking into the ideas i want to bring out, the basic explanation > where it doesnt work > where it doesnt feels tough to work with. 
- scratch that - they make sense right now, but ultimately are placeholders for more specific names when things are more put together.
