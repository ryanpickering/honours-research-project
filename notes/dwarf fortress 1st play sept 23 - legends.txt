starting legends mode... now how to explore it. 

gives me a menu for looknig at things.
- historical figures, sites, artifacts, regions, underground regions, civilizations, strctures, all available to look at
- also examine map and powers that live within it for each 10 year period
- incredible amount of detail!
- markets, demonic towers, temples, etc.
- that piece was right: dealing with this material is impersonal and removes any narrative structure
- couldn't find my own fortress i built :(
