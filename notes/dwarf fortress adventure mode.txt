had this idea for awhile: adventure mode seems the least explored part of DF but shouldn't be
- takes advantage of procedurally generated world in a much smaller context. learn history of the world one area at a time

- experiences within adventure mode: procedurally generated quests, etc! very cool. 

- now, i am going to watch some let's plays on youtube to try and see how people play adventure mode, in preparation for my own playing of it on... monday or tuesday?

- creating a character in ways same as regular RPGs
- immediately placed into a town: access to all houses, characters seem to be talkable to
- talked to some random guy, immediately he joined his group when asked
- his own inventory, the team member's inventory: generated randomly (cool)
- key part of the game to have a squad of members basically
- around 10 minute mark: asks man about his family cause he seemed like a weird character... tells him his family history (cousin, father, aunt etc.)
	- all material in legends mode i assume... but made personable through a character
- this character was a vampire!! you can assume anyone of being a vampire apparently
	- while fighting this vampire, examines vampires armour: level of detail
	- player runs away at first, entire brawl between the denizens of this town and the vampire breaks out and is recorded very extensively. history of world being generated realtime affected by player
- after vampire killed, asks a dying man what he can do, says kill this vampire. a glitch maybe? cool though
- fast travel north to an evil area - game divided between exploring good places, evil places?
- travelled across a mountain of worms?!?! even the player didn't understand...

- lost in the north w/o information
- attacking a group of kobolds - enemies?

-------

clear possibility for engagement with history here if one wanted to explore towns, cities, forts, etc.
- abandoned areas as well for engagement with this material

http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Adventurer_mode
- lots of information on procedure and the like in here
- spent some time exploring the wiki... lots of information on the game, not necessarily connected to lore though at all
- wiki is for instruction and there are lots of jokes throguhout which is interesting
