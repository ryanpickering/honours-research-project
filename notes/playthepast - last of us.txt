 - draws upon an article i know i want to pursue about presence of the past in fallout 3
 - artefacts, ie. diaries, notes, lists, voice recorders, maps, graffiti, etc., IE PRIMARY DOCUMENTS available to be found throughout game
 - some are necessary, but most simply give insight into history of the world ie. zombie outbreak or something
 - backstory of game is never explicitly stated but emerges from exploring lore in clues, these primary documents and in scenes in the world secondary to action (ie dead soldiers from a firing squad)
 - lore adding to experience while not necessary for game completion. what i was talking about in the beginning of this project!!!
