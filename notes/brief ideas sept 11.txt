- archaeology-based perspective on games gives opportunity for dr. graham to give great resources
- however not my strong area???

- not sure where to begin with matrix msu vids... 11 hours combined is bit dense for me today. examining instead electricarchaeology.ca and dr grahams material there on AR
- i'm concerned i can't play his game, the ottawa anomaly (http://philome.la/electricarchaeo/the-ottawa-anomaly/play) w/o a car or better transport system than unreliable oc transpo (ie a bike). wish i could though - interested to see if it goes well
- when on campus next, play his game made to test on carleton campus: http://philome.la/electricarchaeo/test-of-geolocation-triggers/play

- do I want to explore AR? as way to do good historical gaming?
- does it fit with what i think is good historical gaming/what i want to do as good historical gaming??
	- what do i want to do as good historical gaming?
	- what do i NOT want to do as good historical gaming?

- BUILDING vs EXAMINING games as history
- NEW SCHOLARSHIP ([[scholarship through games]]) vs PUBLIC/EDUCATION ([[pedagogy through games]]) through games

those two things are the two difficult decision needed to be made concerning this project. some ideas come up when thinking about them.
- examining games in terms of public history and education seems significantly simpler than examining or building games for scholarship. 
- dr graham also seems more interested in that, with background in public hist, archaeo, interest in pedagogy
- i am initally drawn towards NEW SCHOLARSHIP, as that idea in games seems "revolutionary"
- perhaps too revolutionary? is it doable?
- if not doable in meaningful sense, leaves project nowhere to go. scary idea

- is it important to look at the idea of new scholarship in games? through text adventure, minecraft, civ, AR, etc.
- if so, how do we show that? By building? Analyzing possibilities? Analyzing existing things?
	- do things already exist of new scholarship through games? I have a feeling there is not - will *ask dr. graham* about this. 
- if not, is it going to happen? Does it exist? Is it possible? etc.
