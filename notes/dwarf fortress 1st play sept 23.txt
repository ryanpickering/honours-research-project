HERE WE GO!

starting world... 
- complex ways to start world: can't figure out seed gen at first so just starting a random world
- generating world w/ medium everything, very long history, low beasts/savagery, frequent minerals.
- generating history right now... running through each year takes about a second
- year 139 for example has 144K unique events. LOTS of processes here...
- different ages split time periods... ie. age of myth. i'm sure much of this will be able to be explored later on in legends mode
- minutes later, year 500 has almost 750K unique events... holy crow
- also lists # of historical figures and # of dead 
- stopped history at year 703, w/ 125K hist. figures, 107K dead, 1.1million events.
- exporting image/info... findable on github under ______
- HERE WE GO FOR REAL!

saving the world atm...
- make take a bit?
- updated world, now have to pick a location.
- searching based on lots of different factors
- found a nice spot
- naming fortress Ucatsuthmam Rekednoval Enir (Beerbreeches the Buttery Bride of Beguilers)
- now to embark!

begun construction of a fort per video instructions... neat now advanced the game is
- building fortress in which to have a foothold in this world
- from there can explore history

woooh... got really drawn into game. have to make a note of focusing on doing RESEARCH in the game as opposed to just playing. tricky tricky tricky to stay focused

oh... can't play DF in both fortress mode AND legends/adventure mode... disappointing. 

retiring: settles the fortress into "rhythm of day to day living beyond my meticulous concern"
- neat: my fortress (tiny) becomes part of world now
- saves and now i can look at legends mode perhaps?
- my actions add on to legends mode accessible history... hmmmm
