some readings to look at briefly for their thoguhts on wikis as places of negotiation for history, esp. for videogames
also archival theory: jump into this slowly before talking to dr graham about it

- dr. graham and i discussed this awhile ago: 2nd thesis meeting

- wikis have altered the power structures of knowledge and the dissemination of info
- universities, authorization of knowledge, etc., no longer can be considered only option
- wikis allow networked epistomology and collective production of knowledge
- wikipedia introduced in 2004: encyclopedia editable by anyone!
- origins of wiki as means for software development - appropriated from there (sort of how i/others have appropriated github's hosting style for open notetaking)
- darwinian principles of editing and submitting things to wikis: the most proficient edits and most accurate knowledge will stick and falsities will be weeded out
- just how accurate IS wikipedia though?
- (i dont want to discuss wikipedia though, i want to discuss OTHER wikis.. time to move on from this section

- wikis = open source: how does this transform to the classroom?
- many different types of using wikis in pedagogical settings - as classroom resource/reference, as presentation, gateways to other materials, as simulation of experience (following paths, decisions points, etc)
(more to come: I want to move to article specifically on video game wikis before i end work for the night)

REALLY want to take a look at this... paywall is my enemy here though.
