TRANSLATION FROM GAME TO STORY

framework atm: 
- boluk's ideas of translation of non-human operators to human stories and processes of that
- how that engages historical thinking, historical consciousness
- same wineburg, peter seixas: use to highlight what those are and how narrativization engages
- examples elsewhere: trevor owens, emily johnson
