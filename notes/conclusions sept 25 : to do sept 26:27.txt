- DF adventure mode is a great place to explore how gamers can potentially engage with procedurally gen'd worlds/histories in a different way than fortress mode.
- need to look more into legends mode, and specifically legends viewer: wikify the history
- do research into narratives created out of DF play: boatmurdered, bravemule, dfstories, etc. see what stands out and what stories have in common
	- http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=39897.60 also this as a bizarre example
- not going to find any "lore" material on DF wiki... check out lore of skyrim or fallout wikis and explore it AND conversations going on in the background
- read more on wiki theory and apply to those wikis
- go back to ideas on archives / archival theory: remember why it is important and take notes on ideas related to it
- dr graham recommends...
	- writing history in digital age
	- web writing for liberal arts
	- two online books that he contributed to but there is material relating to videogames. 
- play curious expedition (dr graham tweeted it at me): procedural exploration game to add to list of PG games (it is free this weekend that's why!!!!!)**
