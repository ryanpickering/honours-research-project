Legends Mode as it's own thing perhaps?

how do all of these fit into my historical thinking categories?

hist. significance - COMICS, THOLTIG, CACAME
- all these stories sift through lots of material to give significance. narratives cannot represent all 
- each story either pulls something interesting from world (tholtig, cacame), 
- or represents certain aspects of game above others, giving weight. 
- comics like matul remrit, bronzemurdered, oilfurnace. give weight to certain aspects of game to tell compelling visual story. 
primary sources  - LATERNWEBS, BOATMURDERED, ALL GAMES
- all games are priamry sources - the code, gameplay, etc. they are changed into fully formed narratives instead. 
- videogame as fonds
- laternwebs vs. boatmurdered. both pull from primary sources... laternwebs as one person telling the tale, boatmurdered as engagement of community with access to game file. 
**(those two are the easiest to make connections to when working here. it is the next 4 that become difficult and much more specific)
continuity and change - LEGENDS MODE, BOATMURDERED, OILFURNACE, THOLTIG, CACAME
- evaluating change over time... boatmurdered as a community fortress with collaborative history!
- or oilfurnace, along with tholtig cryptbrain and cacame? 
- changes in otherwise unreadable society culminate in fantastic stories. 
- players engage with history to understand new things emerging from the gameplay
- legends mode
cause and consequence - COMPLEXITY THEORY, THOLTIG, CACAME
- circumstances leading to consequence
- consider AGENCY... complexity theory emerges here? complex causes for ascnedancy of certain figures, events happening, etc. make connections between long-term and short term ideas. 
- with that said, again, tholtig cryptbrain and cacame. causes both readable and unreadable in game / code respectively
hist perspective 
- vast differences between the past and us = vast differences between the game and the player?
- ideas of nonteleological histories of DF, and the translation aspect
- seen in cacame in this way - inhabit worldview of dwarves in order to comedicize and relate to fantastic story
ethical dimension - MATUL REMRIT, BOATMURDERED, OILFURNACE, ONE DWARF AGAINST THE WORLD
- can't use this in the same way as seixas does with realworld history
- instead, use as framework for how neutral DF stories are defined, shaped, framed. 
- matul remrit vs. boatmurdered vs. oilfurnace vs. one dwarf against the world. 

looking at these games, community engagement has to be a key aspect of the conversation. 

tholtig, cacame, one dwarf against the world - history of one dwarf (microhistory)
comics - history of one fortress laid out simply - microhistory as well
matul remrit - different than all the others: dark, brooding, emotionally fulfilling vs fun and silly.
boatmurdered - community story.
