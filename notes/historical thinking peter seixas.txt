in onder to think historically (think critically about history, uses and abuses) students must...
 1.	Establish historical significance
 - the past is everything: what is significant for study / remembering?
 - depends upon persepctive and purpose: WWI significant, but regional history, local history, social history, etc. 
 - significance through larger trends and stories that reveal important things for us TODAY
 2.	Use primary source evidence
 - read historical sources (primary docs) different than a textbook: evidence vs. information
 - w/ evidence, must question it, make inferences, consider context
 3.	Identify continuity and change
 - history not a list of events, look for change and continuity where other factors suggest there has been none
 - change over time through progress/decline (questionable in my eyes...)
 4.	Analyze cause and consequence
 - what are the long/short term causes htat led to long and short term consequences of any one event?
 - causes differ on one event, based on historical scale it is approached with. 
 5.	Take historical perspectives
 - understanding the social, cultural, intellectual, and emotional settings that shaped people’s lives and actions in the past
 - the past is a foreign country
 - comprehension of vast differences between us and the past: situate events in context
 6.	Understand the ethical dimension of historical interpretations.
 - two things: what responsibility does today have in connection with historical injustice ie. residential schools, holocaust, etc
 - also, ethical judgements about historicla actions
 - converse to historical perspective, which is placing events in context
 - can't really do that for nazis, slavery, etc. 
 - learn things from the past that help us face ethical issues of the present
 
 what to pull away from this?
 - this is specifically the type of historical consciousness that i need to look for in considering the creation of it in games like DF
