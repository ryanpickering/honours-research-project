see: no man's sky and dwarf fortress

looking into this to better understand DF and how to look at the histories it creates for players uniquely

http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/procedural-generation-took-gaming-industry/
- looks into procedural generation in videogames and why its popular. also how it came about and if it is good for gaming today
- creation of content through algorithms/code, NOT through people. element of randomness
- ***here is a good place to bring in info about complexity theory/agent based modelling***
- rouge (1980) as most important early example: ascii characters used to represent dungeons that were generated at random so no playthrough would be the same (clearly DF draws from this!!!)
- tetris as new kind of puzzle game w/o just one solution. 
- randomized elements of games cannot be found outside of videogames mostly
- diablo in 1996: like rogue but more visually appealing
- mentions minecraft and dwarf fortress as most powerful representations of this procedural gaming

http://www.giantbomb.com/procedural-generation/3015-328/
- gives list of games using procedural generation for games - not important atm
- concept wiki: explores history of concept
- references fascinating video given by creator of PITFALL: early procedural world creation due to memory constraints
	- http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014632/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PITFALL ... click on section 'world layout' and it explores polynomial generation of world. super simple but gives cool look into way procedural generation works in early days
- notes entirely procedurally generated game, elite: http://www.giantbomb.com/elite/3030-10902/

http://www.gizmag.com/creative-ai-procedural-game-development-angelina/35874/
- talks about creative AI making procedurally generated videogames!!!
- ANGELINA creating games by operating along theme lines, extrapolating, applying them to narrow game ideas ie sidescrollers
- AI as way to tackle game design issues - bring new ideas to the table by just being diff. than people
- automating game design ie. racetrack design, world design
- vast worlds can be created w/ procedural generation but are uninteresting if no interesting things to make players do interesting things
- this piece more about AI...

http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/10/5192058/opinion-stop-dwelling-on-graphics-and-embrace-procedural-generation
- two ways for game designers to make players feel "free" right now
	- trick them into following the correct way
	- build every possibility behind every door
- this second possibility limits to big budget studios - procedural generation of open worlds open it up
- back in beginning days of 3d, okay to just make worlds for the look. now defined by interactivity
- explores ideas of procedurally generated games: unique ecosystems, unique worlds where game plot elements are put in wherever you end up, ideas of procedurally generated games allowing interesting change to occur in small spaces/activities

https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/
- an entire reddit based on procedurally generated content! includes games along w/ pics, vids, etc.
- will explore later***

http://pcgbook.com/
- entire online textbook dedicated to procedurally generated games - literally the motherload source
- http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter07.pdf - chapter based on story: will devote entire note to later

http://pcg.wikidot.com/
- wiki connected to above textbook i believe
- more primary sources relating to procedurally generated content ie source codes - huge resource

- procedurally generated history game
- dr graham very hyped on this one - draw into DF in a big way
