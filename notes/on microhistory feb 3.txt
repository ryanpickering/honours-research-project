ON MICROHISTORY

- article is very theoretical, author claims
- attempt to examine common elements between pieces of microhistory
	- important for me, as I want to see all DF narrative as microhistory so must compare.
- starting in 1970s, cultural debate around historiography in a lot of ways. questioning methods
- positivism weighed down inquiry. look for new forms to inquire and get to truth
- microhistory started w/ lots of marxists - looking for roots of man's behaviour and truth about that and how he acts in a world of limited freedom w/ constraints of oppressive/prescriptive normative systems. 
- negotiation b/w personal freedom and limiting systems. microhistories as inquiry into nature of free will in societies.
- refute relativism

- as a practice, reducing scale of observation as low as possible for intesive study
- discussion of scale imperative for microhistory : how can one separate the individual histories and contexts with the massive structures that form their worlds (ie market conditions, history of markets, history of commerce, etc.)
- scale cannot be studied as its own object - small scale systems arent just linked to larger systems when appropriate, but each minute event should be part of the larger discussion of system. 
- unifying principle of all microhistories: reducing scale shows previously unseen factors and qualities
	- even in scenarios where it is not expected ie land prices
	- links to larger systems and shows individuality of specific contexts

- many roots of  this in anthropology and thick description: inserting microscopic events in context to let things emerge
- spends a lot of time comparing anthropology to microhistory - not exceptionally useful for me atm

THIS READING IS SO DENSE AND WORDY - i am struggling writing it all down right now. the earlier easy summary of microhistory i took notes should do for microhistory - if not, i will come back to this. 

summary of topics it explores further...
- contextualization!

conclusion:
- conditions and positions on microhistory levi talks: reduction of scale, debate about rationality, small clue as paradigm, role of the particular(not in opposition to social), attention to narrative and reception, definition of context, rejection of relativism
- microhistories attempting to dispel rigid typologies, dualistic hypotheses, etc. and come to fluid conception of history and such
