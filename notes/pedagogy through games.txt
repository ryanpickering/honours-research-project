I am less drawn to this but see many possiblilities in pursuing this path

dr graham's ideas on this during our first meeting: [[thesis meeting 1]]...

Meeting w/ high school teachers - oral history of using video games in high school classes and going from there into the conference mid-February and taking the lead on that. Fold that into final project on history of video games as used in class and where to go from there. 
- ethics board approval to talk to teachers and use their material
[[conference]]

How people play history games
- let's plays, forums, etc. 
I examined this idea and immediately came up with an interesting idea not totally based on history games but games with a sort of history... not sure if it is a good one to explore though. lots of thought on it in here though - [[LORE in ahistorical games as history in historical games]]
