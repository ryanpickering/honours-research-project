- microhistory: intesive hist investigation of a small area. flagship of contemporary social historians
- creates a focal point for studying, w/ intensity unparalled when studying nations, states, long duree history, etc.
	- this perfectly encapsulates DF narratives!
- statement of facts is not important, what IS important is the significance given to them
- superior to macro social history b/c of 4 characteristics: appealing to public, realistic, conveys personal experience, branches out far
	- all of these can be applied to DF!

- level of little facts of history: interpretations cannot be proven right or wrong. competition of scholarly interpretations defined by power relations
- reality can be grey, but hypotheses must be interesting: microhistories generate appeal!! 
	- DF popular in community 

- gets "reality effect" (roland barthes) - closer relation to little facts allows for stronger reality feeling. 
- kracauer: more real history
- closer to people of history
	- DF microhistories bring close contact to specific entities and examples in world as opposed to macro history. 

- microhistory allows conveying lived experiences to readers directly on everyday life level
- interpret experience on the level of experience
	- DF obviously allows for this: shared experience of the game comes through in narrativization of DF
	
- representing the case in microhistory must include the multiple contexts of peoples lives so that the histories aren't false when measured by the whole
- thus reconstructing life in as many contexts as possible allows for less influecning by a historians personal agenda
- microhistory presents diverse amount of contexts in a very limited frame
- extrapolate to understand a society, etc. never isolated from the general but instead always bearing to it.
