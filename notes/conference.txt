conference is one of the strongest ideas so far. allows for engagement with students, educators, academics re: games. 
- also a showable result of the work this year, a place to engage people on ideas developed up till february, and use the conference to shape final project. 
- could conference be used for both examining pedagogy and scholarship? maybe too much... *ask dr graham* this
- that then expands project maybe too wide to do effectively/concisely. 

going off first idea he suggests... emphasis on HOW videogames are used in class.
- that can draw on both pedagogy and scholarship
- examine benefits of both
- however, i wanted scholarship thru videogames to look at academic institutes ie universities as a way to get original research out: this will not go on in high schools (i assume) 
- rephrase to, are students USING/PLAYING/MAKING videogames to learn?
- making a videogame effectively to show scholarship - does not necessarily need to be *new* research.
