lots of ideas have come to me thus far - 
- exploring AR as just a way to build historical games, draw that into some other project here
- examining false histories (lore) in games as a jumping off point for inclusion of historical material in history games
	- perhaps drawing into doing original scholarship with videogames
- talking with high school teachers about use/play/creation of videogames as history. draw that into conference
	- what does the conference entail though? minecraft? twine? AR?
	- what is the final project here? a guide for teachers on how to use videogames? an explanation of where videogames have come/are going in education? feels vague to me thus far. 
	
most exciting idea to me ATM is lore as history in videogames. that's the number one idea i want to run past dr. graham come monday morning. 
however, AR is very cool to me as well, i look forward to trying it out this weekend, will update on sunday hopefully. i do have other readings to accomplish before end of weekend so we will see on timing. 
i also want to know about finding more on what ORIGINAL scholarship has been done through videogames. do we honestly think it's possible? is it worth exploring?

this is the end of my notes for sept 11 i think, at least for a bit. committing to github now.

also have decided i'm going to update my official updates page every monday or tuesday? will relay that onto the updates page now.
