this is exactly what i was intending to work on... how does this affect what we were intending to do?
 - her piece explores precisely what i wanted: historical consciousness through connections with the past in games, ie. lore and primary documents
 - she does it primarily in skyrim: a game i wanted to discuss
 - can i use this piece as a source or is it too similar to everything i want to do?

okay, this allows for a bit of a restructuring of the thesis - towards dwarf fortress? towards... ideology as historical consciousness? towards ways of doing good history through this lore?

if we can keep moving with this piece, this will be a major resource im sure, not just for info but for some methodology on working with this material. (all cited of course)
