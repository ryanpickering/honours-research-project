https://www.academia.edu/5099437/Experienced_Archaeologies_A_mini-ethnography_exploring_the_way_in_which_people_engage_with_the_past_in_single_player_role-playing_videogames

this is exactly what i was intending to work on... how does this affect what we were intending to do?
 - her piece explores precisely what i wanted: historical consciousness through connections with the past in games, ie. lore and primary documents
 - she does it primarily in skyrim: a game i wanted to discuss
 - can i use this piece as a source or is it too similar to everything i want to do?

okay, this allows for a bit of a restructuring of the thesis - towards dwarf fortress? towards... ideology as historical consciousness? towards ways of doing good history through this lore?

if we can keep moving with this piece, this will be a major resource im sure, not just for info but for some methodology on working with this material. (all cited of course)

dr graham thinks this is really useful!!!!
allied but different - doesn't conflict with historical consciousness idea
sit down and read this piece as soon as possible

(notes!)

- ethnographic methods to study how/if gamers engage with the past in skyrim: they do
- draws from archaeology, anthropology, game studies
- illustrate importance of entertainment regarding knowledge of the past
- fisrt chapter is a critical analysis on existing it. on game studies/archaeo
- mentions both playthepast.org and archaeogaming.com
- Heritage and Archaeology, Anthropology and Ethnography, and Game Studies: 3 masin areas of (often overlapping) study)
- within game studies, ludology vs narratology: important for ethnography going on
- ethnography is involved analysis of a way of life requiring immersion: type of anthropology
- aspects of ethnography we can use to critically judge it:
	- questioning the extent to which the work contributes to our understanding of social life, 
	- the reflexivity with which the text was written, 
	- the effect that the piece has on the reader themselves, 
	- and to what extent the text expresses a reality

- METHODOLOGY for examining Skyrim
- ethnography and research on people possible to be fully anonymous and fully observing, not changing what you observe
- benefits to joining the community for discussion though
- influential online ethnography of text based bulletin boards in the 90s, etc. 
- what will the methodology be for analyzing online social lives of players of single player RPGs?
	- this is similar to what i am working with
- field of study was several online forums relating to skyrim ie bethesda's own forums
- also an anonymous questionaire relating to the subject, distributed through social media
- pg 27 28 talks about ethical considerations of looking at forums*** use this in reation to kurt's ethics app
- postprocedural archaeology theoretical frame (post modernist), constructivist grounded
- looking at her results, methodology skewed what she though tshe was going to get - got lots of survey response but searching forums took a long long time

CASE STUDY INTRO
- (skyrim as neomedievalism - fantasy genre to give legacy to america vs colonial legacy)
- drawing parallels between tamriel (gameworld) and our own
- lore (incomplete and socially constructed) adds to engagement and credibility of gameworld
- for lore, does bethesda utilize archivists, historians etc, to organize and create history in game? answer: no - informally people in company know it, but they use fan wikis moreso
- organization of lore by fans acts as jumping off point for continuation of lore in subsequent games by creators!!!
- potential here for employment of experts - historians, archaeologists, etc. 

ANALYSIS
- in forums, gamers interact with the past in many ways: discussing lore and mythology of the game world, desire to practice archaeology in game, discussion of representation of cultures in game ie. viking culture and the "nords" of skyrim, 
- in the survey, lots of things discussed
- Why play skyrim? 
	- Developer heritage/cultural heritage: 
		- game is significant to todays culture, been playing developers games for awhile, scandinavian influence of game, etc.
	- escapism
	- immersive game experience "virtual tourism"
	- scope of customization of character and experience
	- depth of narrative
- how does the medieval setting make the game more enjoyable?  
	- added to believability of game, made it more familiar... shared image of ancient European ancestry?
		- comforting stereotypes like this a negative trend
	- interest in real world history allowed for cool engagement with medieval setting
	- escapism: root of western society, "better times", etc. problematic as depicitng those times as "simpler" or underdeveloped
	- can actually engage with historical/archaeological practice in game, ie lore understanding, indiana-jones-esque tomb raiding, etc. 
	- aesthecially pleasing
- Which aspects of the game connect skyrim to history/archaeology?
	- real world history: connection to real history themes of today, familiarity
	- in game engagement with lore******************
		- MY PROJECT
		- most common response
		- engaging with history through primary sources, in a non-linear, subjective way (organic)
	- physical attributes reminded people of landscape, architecture, etc. in the real world
	- socio-cultural-political parallels: diversity of cultures, mirroring of real world political things, ie. roman empire or nazis (thalmor)
	- narrative / language: the character you paly as "makes history"... brings about ideas of agency!

theory of archaeological understanding in skyrim: different dichotomies of experience within the game
- real history and in game lore ******
	- links w/ real world history (inspiration and the like) - though none of this is really created through research, but stereotypes/fiction
- history vs archaeology as activity in skyrim
	- either engaging with history of Tamriel as comparison to our own world as historians, or interacting w/ trails of evidence in skyrim as archaeo.s
	- both of these come from players learning experiences and understandings of what is "history" or "archaeology" as have been presented in western pop culture: don't account for multiplicity in either discipline
- types of archaeology/ways of doing it: embodied vs conceptual
	- embodied/material archaeology: people being in the world and experiencing it
	- conceptual: archaeological ways of thinking to understand the worlds they inhabit
		- the way RPGs make their games archaeological in nature: exploration and discovery?
		
will come back to the bibliography of this piece in the near future

main pullaway: does a lot of the research i intend on doing, therefore i can cite some of the research and conclusions in this? theories and conclusions made form the research are archaeological in focus, therefore different from what i want to do and able to put that to the side for now. **idea of gamers engaging with lore as historians do is confirmed in this piece! it's neat!
- from this point being confirmed, now easier to branch out into the actual meat of it - discussion on wikis, wikis in general, etc. 
- apply ideas of this ethnography to DF as well: exploration, even though aesthetically pleasing medieval world applies not at all
- adventure mode of DF akin to exploration of skyrim and the like?
- histories that both exist separately as their own units, or can be explored first person by the player
	- ie legends mode of DF/adventure mode, wikis of RPG/playing and discovering in the RPG
