REALLY cool short piece that touches on some ideas of historical consciousness in videogames.
 - touches on 4 uses of museums in games: story drivers, world enrichers/debate, political devices, identity
 - first one not important to my analysis, but 2 and 3 are! Not sure about 4
 - world enrichers: idea of lore for me, tertiary non-necessary pieces of the game that enrich world's narrative (and leads into a quest too)
 - place of power, place of controversy. however, doesn't touch on all facets of lore i like - this focuses more on structure of museum vs. power of fictional content.
 - political devices: now we're getting somewhere! tertiary information telling about the world from a specific viewpoint
 - ideology in games is historical consciousness in games!!!
 - seeing history and material created for "others" (ie. NPCs in gameworld) out of context to reveal interesting features and truths about gameworld
 - bioshock 2 and bioshock infinite examples... leads me to want to explore those games or one of them possibly in larger thesis.
 - identity: factions in games are represented by their (fictional) history and this is used to instill pride in players. 
 - lore of the world learnt not through plot, but world exposition. 
 - arguably secondary/tertiary to gameplay but also central to characters and their factionism
 - hmmmmmmmmmm
