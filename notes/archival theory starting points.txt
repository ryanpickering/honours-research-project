- notes on what should make up a graduate studies program in archival studies
- http://www2.archivists.org/gpas/curriculum/records-cultural-memory : "Records and papers in all forms constitute an important part of the written memory of individuals and society. They provide the basis for holding governments and organizations accountable and for protecting the rights of individuals. Archival institutions thus play a significant role in society. However, they are only part of the fabric of cultural memory. Archivists and archives work in cooperation with other professionals (including, but not limited to, those who work for historical societies, libraries, and museums) to preserve and provide access to cultural memory. Students should understand the interrelationships among archives and other stewards of cultural heritage and the ways in which records complement that heritage."
