 - examines player obsession with zelda timeline and chronology, leading to fan interpretations of the timeline
 - even with the release of an official timeline via hyrule historia, fans see conflicting evidence and use historical methodologies to examine games for their place in the timeline
 - connects with idea of player created lore - not creation per se, but organization
 - gamers as historians, engaging critically with their games and subtleties that place them in certain areas of the timeline
 - engaging with primary and secondary sources, cool
 - interesting piece, but tenuous connections to my material?
