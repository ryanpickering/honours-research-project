heres an idea:
video games are a form of escapism, through their immersion. that is what makes them powerful, they create new realities in which to explore ideas and values etc. 
but augmented reality bypasses that - sticks to the already existing reality. ***does that make it better or worse as "gaming"?
- yes: misses the point of escapist ideas, less freedom to explore different ideas not necessarily location based, 
	- less of an audience when game requires doing work, moving around a city/area?
- no: stays local and therefore maybe more effective/understandable, perhaps MORE immersive b/c of grounded in reality. 
	- real connection to the game in which there is legitimate work of moving around a city/area?
	
will come back to this idea later
