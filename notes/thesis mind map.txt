Narrativization comes from... 
- WIKIS
- FORUMS
- PLOT
- TYPES OF HISTORY
- EMERGENT CULTURE

Historical consciousness emerges from the narrativization of lore/game experience as a way of filling in the blanks
- comes out of emergent cultures in game and COMMUNITY (forums)
- historical thinking is needed to narrativize -> leads to historical consciousness
- complexity theory comes into this, allows for it
- situated/actuated in GAMEWORLD: drawing back to emergent culture and archival theory
	- narrativization/narrative as reordering archival pieces of gameplay
	- archaeogaming and the material culture of games
	- narrative structure as histoy. 
- lore is tied up in game experience, being optional. A connecting piece between AAA games and DF.
	- levels of engagement with material; Bartle test. 
	- filling in the blanks
		- DF: fill in blanks of objective text/ASCII gameplay to construct compelling story (Proc. gen.)
		- AAA: understand *obscured* narratives through piecing together of material; fill in blanks of complex world
			- wikis as place for this as well. 
- Piecing together stories from experience: manipulation of game experience/material as organizing/drawing from the FONDS
