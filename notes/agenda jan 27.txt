alright - just finished that table of contents exercise. gonna put together 500 words on that thing, publish it, share it. but, what to have done for end of next wednesday, the 3rd???

what to have done by the 13th...

- notes on all narrativization pieces, plus individual/others experience of GAME and LEGENDS
- have basis in other literature - synthetic worlds, good history thru gaming, dwarven epitaphs, wiki material, fonds material.

what to have done in ONE WEEK: 
- material fleshed out on: complexity theory, community/bartle test, fonds and archival theory, wiki theory
- notes on all intended narrative pieces
- notes on impact of aspects of DF on historical engagement in the future - BOOKS, SCHOLARS, ETC. 

how to break that down into simpler pieces...

- revisit fonds piece, theory of mine. shape to fit specifically DF for narrative/historical thinking purposes. 1.5 hours.
- draw connections between community, wiki, and archival theory - maybe even nix wiki stuff. 1.5 hours.
- play DF fortress for 45 minutes-1 hour, while making notes on new features, and then spend 45 minutes-1hour reading toady material. come to conclusions relating to how these might impact past/future stories. 3 hours.
	- to do this, have to build up a fort moreso, right now i have only a hole in the ground. a good fort takes a bit of time and focus to do... do this on sunday morning while i recover from cast party (lololol)

- skim synthetic worlds for emergent culture ideas.  
	
revisit this list tomorrow morning and look at how to schedule it out. 
- idea of doing all readings/notes in one day is scary... maybe spread them out.
