 - contrary to points about tertiary lore but interesting, like dwarf fortress, in context of game histories and historical consciousness
 - DayZ is a mod w/ no storyline or plot or narrative: just players and zombies in the game
 - where DF is computer generated history, DayZ is entirely player generated history
 - players record their own stories and discuss them - much like MMOs I guess (wait, this is an MMO... doi)
 - "throwaway history" - not important in a grand sense but impactful and representative of a community of sorts within the gameworld
