as i wrote in the note 'games with lore to explore'...

 already thinking of using...
 - dwarf fortress
 - eve online??????
 
 to narrow down, picking most useful ones.
  - fallout
  - elder scrolls games
  - bioshock
  - half life
  - thief
  - myst
  
  -------
how to fit these games together?
- dwarf fortress a must: procedurally created lore content too cool to ignore
- fallout and skyrim/elder scrolls have vast quantity of backstory and lore, all sort of hidden
	- fallout's more hidden than skyrim's
- half life like uncovering a mystery
- bioshock has ideological twists to lore and history - shows cracks in image of society
	- primary documents as contrary to official stories
	- VALIANT HEARTS: THE GREAT WAR!
	- did not use that article initially but glad i thought of that game
	- http://www.playthepast.org/?p=5063
- thief... cool but don't know much about the game
- myst... same

all along the lines of historical consciousness...
- fallout / skyrim / mass effect: metastory, knowing the long history
- half life, bioshock, valiant hearts: uncovering/learning new spin on history/a new story
- thief and myst: look into more!!
