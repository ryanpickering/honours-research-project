- picked an adventurer, set sail w/ a message for a leader.
- oh i see: procedurally generated map that reminds me of settlers of catan!
- things to do on expedition and locations generated?
- different type of procedural generation: not so much as DF but organization of predetermined events
- i came across a golden pyramid! it won me the level i guess. 
- most levels harder than that? got to pick a level up perk - neat customization of character as well then not unlike rpgs
- very cool procedural generation - events in villages, areas to stumble upon, etc. 
- competition of a game to race your "comrades" i guess
- pretty fun game: this whitewashes all aspects of colonization and exploration though which is interesting
- game got really hard on the third level: i have been in this area for over 100 days!!
- the end game is always a goden pyramid... how many golden pyramids ARE there???
- i died!!! richard francis burton is no more. 

a very interesting type of procedurally generated game... with an obvious goal though. neat! the game is in alpha still - it would be cool to see more archaeological materials procedurally generated to examine and draw things from. 

this game is a little problematic? anything that really paints explorers of the 18th/19th century in a good light is a bit problematic... but still, very neat. i suppose they don't do anything that makes me cringe regarding that TOO much, but even so. 

implications of either donating artifacts or selling them - neat, but centred on archaeology
