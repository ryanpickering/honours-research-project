 - preservation of MMO worlds for the future: problem of recording interactions and cultural history of such places (type of lore?)
 - oral history one solution: ethnography that records unique experiences in places 
 - construction of the past through lived experiences of players: a type of historical consciousness in games
 - this type of consciousness specific to MMOs though
 - ehh, maybe not so useful to the kind of work i want to do. but maybe - could come back to this later
