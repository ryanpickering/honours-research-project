HOW people play history games... i feel pessimistic w/ this idea.
- limits to mainstream games ie. assassins creed, civilization, etc. 
- or, maybe allows engagement of historical process in non-historical games ie. bioshock?
- maybe look at engagement with false histories or games ie fallout, bioshock, etc., see what is represented there, then how gamers discuss and find them, THEN turn that into guidelines on how to represent actual history in videogames in an effective way?
- by doing this, create a historical videogame through looking at successful ahistorical videogames and their engagement with (fake) histories?

really turned around my thinking on this one fast lol

- other ways to explore HOW people play these games...
- i feel like there is little/little usable material on actual "historical" non-mainstream games
- that limits engagement w/ public opinion of them 
- leaning WAY towards the above idea instead then. 

this has been a productive note... all of this came out very stream of consciousness style. 
SO a really great idea is engaging with made up histories, stories, primary documents etc. in videogames, such as rpgs where there is a lot of tertiary non necessary written material, look at gamer's engagement with that, and reframe it on the basis of HISTORICAL engagement. from there, develop ideas on how to build an effective historical videogame/actually build an effective historical videogame.

this idea, however, nixes the [[conference]] idea. hmmmmmmm.

this idea REALLY grabs my attn., but is astronomically different than other avenues we thought about pursuing. let's examine pros and cons, though i must note this is the idea getting me the most excited right now. 

pros:
- really really cool
- engages with mainstream games in a relatable way: everyone thinks lore is cool!
- engages with successful games in a historical way, allows for conversation on actual scholarship in games
- ability to create games that will resonate w/ gamers but are historical
- lore is primary documents in games... primary documents are best way to show interesting history. arrange themselves in such a way that tell a story
- ways to incorporate lore into gameplay without making it sole emphasis of. maybe learn from these videogames (RPGs) some ways to make historical videogame more appealing?

cons: 
- maybe not useful to examine: specific to good videogames and good stories?
- lore gets power from being mysterious and unknowable in it's complete form...
	- history is unknowable in a complete way, sure, but also not that mysterious. anyone can google the war of 1812 and understand it. 
	- lore perhaps examines fringe ideas, fringe stories that are not known. irrelevant to well-known/public/educational history.
- gameplay of these games never revolving around lore, many people can/do ignore lore. so what does the gameplay of a historical game utilizing lore look like? does it draw from lore or is lore tacked on?
- does this undermine interactivity that is powerful in videogame history? just finding documents does not make for good gameplay. 

*ask dr graham* about this idea
