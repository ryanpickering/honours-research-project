 - fallout 3 has deep deep history that is explorable
 - one can act as a sort of future archaeologist examining primary documents from before the war
 - personal stories add complexity and depth to overarching story of survival in post-apocalypic world
 
 pasting long list-quote from article which is very important...
 - why reading primary source materials in games like this is important/good history!
 
 " 1.	Interpreting authentic forms of writing: People don’t leave history books around, they leave personal journal entries, duty logs, planning documents, etc. Part of playing the historical game is to imagine yourself in the role of the creator of the document and read them on the terms they were written.
 2.	Dealing with gaps: There is no complete record. The game requires players to extrapolate from disparate and scant sources. This in part creates the mystery that drives the history game (both for fallout players and for real life historians.)
 3.	The documents are full of relevant and irrelevant information: The documents contain all kinds of potentially relevant and irrelevant technical information. Players need to be able to tell what does and doesn’t matter in the morass of materials they come across.
 4.	Relevance of the information is connected to what you want to know: The above documents include information about personal reactions, about strategic decision making, about attempts to get into the Vaults. Depending on what you are interested in you will need to pay attention to different parts of the documents. 
 5.	Resequencing evidence: As you acquire information you need to piece it together. Things only come in sequence, like these logs, in cases where that is legitimate to the artifact. As you travel the world you need to put these pieces back together into your own history of the world.
 6.	Dealing with conflicting evidence: The authenticity of the documents is further challenged by the fact that people lie, people frame things in ways that make them look good, some people (and robots) are just plain delusional. In The Wasteland Survival Guide quest line this becomes explicit, as you talk to different individuals in rivet city and are required to weigh the truth of different stakeholders accounts and corroborate those accounts with physical evidence.
 7.	You can’t help but read the ending into the documents: When you are standing in the wastes, reading the first log entry you are already reading into it the fact that this is going to end badly. As someone in a historical moment you cannot help but read that moment into every sentence of the account."

 - historical thinking essential to this videogame!!! this is the game/article that inspired this project i would say
 - history as negotiation and creation of understandings of the past
 - examining and critiquing and exploring
 - "Once you care about a world you will do all kinds of things that look like work, or homework. "
 - references wiki as well!!!!
 
 - this article as most representative of what i want to take away from this thesis - is that a bad thing?
 - primary documents inherent in this game can be seen in other ways in other games?
