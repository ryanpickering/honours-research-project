- narrativization research and post
- read synthetic worlds, archaeogaming material: post on gameworld and complexity theory
- do real meaningful looking at artforms in new DF: blogpost specifically about artistic transmission, historical trasmission, etc. 
- draw back to historical consciousness on that
- recognize this material in the scope of DEVELOPMENT of DF - future possibilities
- thus, project as a recognition of possibilities for other games AND for DF itself
