Dwarven Epitaphs: Procedural Histories in Dwarf Fortress

- history of 21st century not just written by humans... automated processes coauthoring next gen stories. 
- algorithms running everyday tasks now
- historians will have to study computer generated material as history, in their terms
- DF foregrounds operational qualities and creates play from engagement with complex systems
- begins by generating dynamically produced natural and social history for up to 1000 years
- recall forms of historical writing departing from human centred and teleological models of history, such as annal, chronicle, calendar.
- community formed to explore/document/translate results of DF into texts called dwarven epitaphs
- intersect fan fiction, fan translation and fan archiving of gameplay
- dwarven epitaphs convert world generator to story generator: mark dissonant registers between human operators and nonhuman operations

- generate world w/ dozens of menus of detailed parameters to generate history too.
- intense processing power needed to do all of this dynamically
- after world generation, games becomes city building/military strategy/physics simulation
- independent dawrven culture can emerge after awhile - dwarves react to things different despite player commands
- "stone-age" graphic user interface
- difficulty of use inspires lots of fan activity - tutorials, articles on Magmawiki, and publications
- no strict requirements for structures, goals, etc. missing much of game material
- sandbox or simulation???
- game challenges 30 years of game/computer development, emphasis on processes rather than graphics/physics. 
- community: "failing is fun" in light of how difficult game is
- dwarven epitaphs commemorating past play, future failure

narrative bookends
- inspiration and result of adamses' system
- deconstructed fantasy stories to uncover logic of genre
- find rules of fantasy, that are then incorporated into algorithmic processes of DF, thus creating unique experiences in each simulation
- ie. story about tortured monster taking revenge and eating someone, turns into large scavengers can eat dead, entity hatred emerges from torture, etc., and wrestling as a game mechanic. 
- translate rules of storyworld into algorithmic processes
- propagate fantasy narrative events over a simulation
- however, cohesive stories akin to adams' do not appear: operate under alternative set of logics. create entire world with bare narrative forms ie calendars, chronicle. 
- player left to fill in pieces of causality
- DF not as stable piece of software but process of production constantly engaged in textual translations and remediations

- players narrativize losses online: short stories, illustrations, comics, etc. 
- players interact with micro- and macro-histories to translate massive amounts of data into legible narrative forms
- ie Tim Denee's comics Oilfurnace and Bronzemurder
- Tholtig Cryptbrain: anomaly in the game discovered in legends mode
- Dwarven Computer: render DF as dwarves themselves into creating a computer in the game. 
- these show, end of the game becomes its own game: move beyond software and presented material and engage in textual pieces: creating narratives and cohesive pieces
- BOATMURDERED: dr graham mentioned this, it is saved in notes somewhere
- layering and combo of DF algorithms produce unpredictable effects: complexity theory
- inexplicability of game claimed as best part: no way to anticipate emergent effects of gameplay
- ephemeral gameplay quality inspres production of narrative Dwarven Epitaphs
- commemorate ephemeral moments in a game w/ no win conditions.

- in videogames, rules of game are conflated w/ mechanics governing gameworld
- social configurations vs. physics. 
- rules are voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles... mechanics are opposite: involuntary and necessary.
- therefore cant cheat DF - no rules, only unavoidable mechanics. ontological experiment?
- DF as toolset/platform to experiment, write narratives and invent new games!!!
- very sandbox-like
- creators of game invest in *emergence* as core design theory
- emergent events come from simple mechanics... mechanics of game put together become greater than sum of parts
- idea of emergence in a thousand years of nonlinear history: every hierarchy is historical construction, product of definite structure generating processes
- movements of geological forms as inscriptions in and of themselves
- nonlinear world self-organization take place everywhere
- considering DF, code in soil?? looks now at dwarven computer

- legends mode and access to textual logs of literally every event: geological formation, architectural constructions, civilizations, historical figures
- mirrors human insignificance to earths timescale
- tiny byte-sized processes indexed from larger processes, given textual interface and archived. easily retrievable. 
- exemplify TALE-SPIN EFFECT???
- story generation system from mid 70s
- deceptively simple for the complex dynamics going on
- no narrative logic of an author or reader in DF legends mode
- like annal, as impersonal list of events by year. no narrative causality
- deprivilege human narrative structure within large cosmological landscape
- conventions of reading passed on from teacher to student, not within books and materials. reading a social practice. books are not 
- same applies to learning rules of DF interface. must apply own understanding of causality and narrative to sparseness of DF, despite massive scale 
- humans estranged from nonhuman atypical modes of history production and representation. 
- hegelian grand narratives rejected by annals: world indifferent to ideology, human struggle, etc. this is the type of history represented by DF 
- locate us within culture hovering on brink of dissolution: take away human agency and narrative recorded in other histories
- few reasons ever given: social events as incomprehensible as natural events, recorded simply because they happened. 
- white attributes annal's neutrality to product of theistic cosmology: "divine will"
- DF, metaphysical/supernatural explanations for unexpected in game phenomenon. most likely bugs/glitches, but no way to distinguish from other game mechanics)
- processes of DF like an indifferent absent god

- DF: white and de landa argue traditional forms of history give way for nonteleological histories, reject narrative coherence and logic of process in favour of discontinuous and emergent complexity
- electronic inscription adds more pressure
- digital tech reconfiguring hist. models
- new forms of historical inscription being automated on unimaginable level: every keystroke logged, google docs records every IP address, etc. 
- microtemporal history of dynamic processes including but not limited to human movements
- despite this change, humans still place ourselves at centre of all
- DF imitates these contemporary inscriptions, w/ dwarves though. 
- dwarven epitaphs as memorials to experience of humans w/ the nonhuman operations of DF
