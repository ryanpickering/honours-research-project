significant post went up today  (nov 6) and rave reviews emerge from @bibliocracy and @adr - two ppl w/ interest in archives and videogames (@adr specifically w/ DF). where to go from here?

- ideas on archives formulated well. continue to develop concept
- really make the decision on engaging with a newer videogame or not - stop saying itll happen but not do any meaningful work with it. 
- pedagogy of videogames important. perhaps place in opposition to fonds theory... with wikis in the middle as mediation between archive and education. 
- in context of where things are going with DF, define LORE. easy to figure out in terms of AAA, but DF is more subtle than that... engravements? narrativization? inside or outside gameworld is the key question
- read synthetic worlds now that you have it to place work in large significance!! also just a cool book i think.
