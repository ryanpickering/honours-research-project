what i see/like as good historical gaming:
- simulation, imaginative representation, ie Minecraft world
- immersive, play-based
actually i don't really know... i haven't thought about historical gaming for awhile. now not sure if i prefer kind of games we worked on in hist3812, or ar gaming dr graham is interested in now. 

after exploring idea of immersion/escapism, i think i would be interested in pursuing that. this weekend i will attempt the ottawa anomaly and see how it goes - taking notes on what i am learning, doing, seeing, experiencing.
