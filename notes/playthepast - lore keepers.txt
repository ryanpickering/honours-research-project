 - organization of lore in videogame worlds. some WoW books have made NYT bestseller list 
 - some of it laid out richly, as a historian would - deep explorations of causality and contingency. 
 - much of it is like family trees, flash card based. knowing names and places and events. 
 - author points out that both come form same world, and both are useful?
 - these kinds of event trees/character trees as maps for understanding actual contingency and events.
 - this article represents two ways of organizing lore in a videogame... interesting. tree-esque lore not what i want to examine but probably still an important part of any examination of it. 
 - how do primary documents and artifacts in games represent this ?
