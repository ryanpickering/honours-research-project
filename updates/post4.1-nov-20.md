## Mini-Post: Mindmap Exercise, and Where Are We Headed?
#### Friday November 20th

Hello everybody! It's been about two weeks since my last post on the blog. I'm thinking I'm going to shoot two blog posts out this weekend to catch up a little: this short one, and a longer one on Sunday (knock on wood) about different examples of narrativization in Dwarf Fortress. I spent a couple hours playing Dwarf Fortress this morning, so I'm ready to get my head out of the game, and into... reading about the game. Ah well! 

The purpose of this post is to share some insights I've come into through doing a quick mindmapping exercise earlier this week. This post is more for my benefit than anyone else's, but will hopefully still show a bit of my thought process at this point. As we come close to the end of the semester, I need to prepare for the huge expanse of work on this thesis I'm going to take on during the break. In our last meeting, Dr. Graham suggested I create a map of all my ideas on the biggest sheet of paper I could find, make as many meaningful connections as I can, and reduce that 2-dimensional map into a 1-dimensional list. The map I came up with looks like this:
