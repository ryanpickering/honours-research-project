## Mini-Post: Mindmap Exercise, and Where Are We Headed?
#### Friday November 20th

Hello everybody! It's been about two weeks since my last post on the blog. I'm thinking I'm going to shoot two blog posts out this weekend to catch up a little: this short one, and a longer one on Sunday (knock on wood) about different examples of narrativization in Dwarf Fortress. I spent a couple hours playing Dwarf Fortress this morning, so I'm ready to get my head out of the game, and into... reading about the game. Ah well! 

The purpose of this post is to share some insights I've come into through doing a quick mindmapping exercise earlier this week. This post is more for my benefit than anyone else's, but will hopefully still show a bit of my thought process at this point. As we come close to the end of the semester, I need to prepare for the large expanse of work on this thesis I'm going to take on during the break. In our last meeting, Dr. Graham suggested I create a map of all my ideas on the biggest sheet of paper I could find, make as many meaningful connections as I can, and reduce that 2-dimensional map into a 1-dimensional list. The map I came up with looks like this:

That in itself is not the most useful picture to understand where I'm heading, but it does give some clues I suppose. After spending probably a good hour doing this, I tried my best to condense it down to some sort of list, with varying success. From my notes:

> Historical consciousness emerges from the narrativization of lore/game experience as a way of filling in the blanks
- comes out of emergent cultures in game and COMMUNITY (forums)
- historical thinking is needed to narrativize -> leads to historical consciousness
- complexity theory comes into this, allows for it
- situated/actuated in GAMEWORLD: drawing back to emergent culture and archival theory
	- narrativization/narrative as reordering archival pieces of gameplay
	- archaeogaming and the material culture of games
	- narrative structure as histoy. 
- lore is tied up in game experience, being optional. A connecting piece between AAA games and DF.
	- levels of engagement with material; Bartle test. 
	- filling in the blanks
		- DF: fill in blanks of objective text/ASCII gameplay to construct compelling story (Proc. gen.)
		- AAA: understand *obscured* narratives through piecing together of material; fill in blanks of complex world
			- wikis as place for this as well. 
- Piecing together stories from experience: manipulation of game experience/material as organizing/drawing from the FONDS

Ta-da! Now, instead of a bunch of notes of material that didn't necessarily reference itself or seem related at all, I have a dense list of ideas that flow into and out of each other in a way that makes sense to me and gives some shape to my project. Before this exercise I was worried about the amount of material I had to work with, but now I'm feeling a lot more confident on a) what material I have at this point, and b) where this project is headed. Some important terms and ideas sort of emerged from this exercise, by coming up as important pieces of the project that I previously hadn't given much thought to, or just being the natural result of considering a lot of these ideas together.They are:

1. Emergent cultures/Complexity theory: 

2. Gameworld/Archaeogaming: 

3. Community: 

4. Game experience as inclusive of lore: 

5.
