## Weekly Updates

Here is where I will be recording some short weekly blogposts concerning my work and progress thus far on my thesis. As of right now, regular meetings with Dr. Graham are hard to anticipate: updates will be announced as they come on Twitter, while my notes will hopefully be updated once a week and will carry the gist, albeit roughly, of posts. Stay tuned!
