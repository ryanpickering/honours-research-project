## Weekly Updates

Here is where I will be recording some short weekly blogposts concerning my work and progress thus far on my thesis. Updates will come either Mondays or Tuesdays following my meetings with Dr. Graham, if applicable. Later on in the year frequency of posts may change - I'll update this page when that happens!
